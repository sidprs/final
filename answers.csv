In packet switching, data is divided into small units called packets, each containing the data payload and control information such as source and destination addresses. These packets are transmitted independently across the network, and they may take different paths to reach their destination. The network resources are shared among multiple communications, and bandwidth is allocated as needed, based on the current traffic and available resources. This allows for efficient use of network resources and supports variable data rates and latency."
